      "content": "When I was little, my uncle Pete had a necktie with a porcupine painted on it. I thought that necktie was just about the neatest thing in the world. I would beg him to wear it whenever he came to visit. I would stroke it and stare at it. For my ninth birthday, he sent me the necktie in the mail. With it came a note: \"Happy birthday. Now it's yours.\"\n\nThat was the best present I ever got.\n\nI kept the necktie on my dresser for a while. I looked at it every day. Then I put it in a drawer. I kept it there until I was about fifteen. Then I forgot about it.\n\nDid my uncle Pete ever know how much I loved that tie? Does he know that I still have it, stuck in a box somewhere in my closet? I thought about him when I first saw her.\n\nWhen she first appeared, I thought of that porcupine necktie. I thought of my uncle. I thought of the question I never asked him: \"Where did you get it?\"\n\nShe was elusive. She was today. She was tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl. We did not know what to make of her. In our minds we tried to pin her to a corkboard like a butterfly, but the pin merely went through and away she flew.\n\nShe was new. She was us. She was different.\n\nShe was Stargirl.\n\nI was in the TV studio when she first showed up. It was a Monday, the first day of school, tenth grade. I was student director of Hot Seat, a program on our local in-school cable station called MAHS (Mica Area High School) TV.\n\nI looked up. I said to Kevin: \"What is that?\"\n\nKevin Quinlan was my best friend and co-producer of Hot Seat. He turned. He looked.\n\n\"A girl,\" he said.\n\n\"But who?\" I said.\n\nAt that moment, people walking by in the hallway stopped, turned, looked.\n\nI looked at Kevin. Kevin looked at me. His face said: I don't know.\n\n\"Someone new,\" he said.\n\nAnd she was gone.",

      "content": "By lunchtime the word was out: \"A new girl in tenth grade.\" Her name was Stargirl Caraway.\n\nStargirl.\n\nWe wondered about that. What kind of name is Stargirl? We laughed. We didn't know what to make of her. The next morning we looked for her. We didn't see her.\n\n\"Maybe she quit,\" said Kevin.\n\nBut she was there. We just couldn't see her. She was surrounded by a mob of curious students. They watched her walk down the hallway.\n\nShe was homeschooled. That's what they said. She had never set foot in a school before now. Her parents had taught her themselves, at home. In the old days that might have gotten them tossed into jail. Now it was legal.\n\nSo she didn't know anything about us. She didn't know that when a new student shows up, he or she is expected to move warily onto the campus, checking things out, sounding people out.\n\nShe didn't know that she was supposed to lay low, not to make waves, to find out who the natives were and what their customs were and then to act accordingly.\n\nShe carried a ukulele, for crying out loud. She sang \"Happy Birthday\" to people. She danced in the rain. She talked to strangers. She sang to her pet rat.\n\nWhen she walked through the halls, the other kids parted before her like the Red Sea. They didn't want to touch her. They didn't want to catch whatever she had.\n\nBut you couldn't help looking. She was impossible to ignore. Her long skirt swished about her ankles. Her lunch consisted of a hard-boiled egg, a few sticks of celery, and a handful of sunflower seeds.\n\nShe wore no makeup. She wore her light brown hair to her waist. But mostly what you noticed was her. Just her.\n\nShe laughed when there was no joke. She danced when there was no music. She had no friends yet she was the friendliest person in school.\n\nIn her first week at school, she turned the place upside down.",

Maybe it was the uncluttered floor. Or the fact that nothing hung on the walls.\n\nWe were sprawled on his bed, eating peanuts, listening to classic rock on his stereo, and talking about Stargirl.\n\n\"I think it's a trick,\" I said. \"I think she's putting on an act.\"\n\nKevin snorted. \"Why would she do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I tossed a peanut at him. \"Why does anybody do anything?\"\n\nKevin caught it and flipped it into his mouth. \"Maybe she's just being herself. Did you ever think of that?\"\n\nI had thought of that. And I didn't know what to make of it. Being yourself was one thing. Being Stargirl was another.\n\nNobody was that different. At least not publicly. Nobody played ukulele in the cafeteria. Nobody sang \"Happy Birthday\" to total strangers. Nobody wore pioneer dresses and antique jewelry.\n\nAs far as we knew, nobody had a pet rat. And nobody, I repeat, nobody, called herself Stargirl.\n\n\"So what's her game?\" I said.\n\n\"Her game?\" Kevin sat up. He stared at me. \"What if it's not a game? What if she's real? What if she really is that different?\"\n\n\"That different,\" I repeated. \"Nobody is that different.\"\n\n\"Prove it,\" he said.\n\nI couldn't. Not then. Not now.",

There were individual variants here and there, of course, but by and large the student body dressed alike, talked alike, ate alike, even moved alike.\n\nWe all had access to the same TV and magazines. We dressed in the same kinds of clothes, listened to the same kinds of music. We wanted to be different. We wanted to be noticed, to stand out. But our idea of different was to change the length of our haircuts by an inch, to wear one brand of sneakers instead of another.\n\nWe may have thought we were different, but we weren't that different. Not Stargirl different.\n\nAt the beginning of the first week, she got a lot of stares. And there were laughs—snickering behind hands—especially at the ukulele. As the week went on, the snickering turned to calls: \"Hey, Stargirl, where's your broom?\" \"Where's your wand, Stargirl?\" \"Make me disappear!\"\n\nBut she didn't seem to notice. She didn't seem to hear. She just kept walking the hallways, alone, her long skirt swishing, her ukulele by her side.\n\nAnd then came Friday.\n\nThe first pep rally of the year. Football season. MAHS versus Red Rock. It was a big deal. The cheerleaders got the bleachers pumping, the players jogged in to wild applause, the band played the school anthem.\n\nAnd then, right in the middle of all the hoopla, Stargirl stood up. She was in the front row of the bleachers. And she began to dance.\n\nNot with anyone. Just herself. Just dancing.\n\nThe music stopped. The cheerleaders stopped. Everyone stopped.

In front of us a thousand students sat frozen in the bleachers.\n\nDown on the gym floor, Stargirl was dancing. As suddenly as it had stopped, the music started again. But nobody moved. Nobody made a sound.\n\nWe might have been looking at a movie, some faraway scene playing out on the gymnasium screen. The music went on, the cheerleaders eventually returned to their routine, but the crowd just stared at the little dance going on in the front row.\n\nI can't remember how long it lasted. Maybe only a few seconds. Maybe a minute. But it seemed much longer.\n\nAnd then someone laughed. One person. The spell was broken. People turned back to the pep rally. The usual yelling and stomping resumed.\n\nAfter the rally, Kevin and I walked out together.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"What just happened?\"\n\nKevin shook his head slowly. He seemed dazed. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I mean, who does that? Who dances alone at a pep rally?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" said Kevin. \"Nobody does that.\"\n\n\"She's either the bravest person in the whole school,\" I said, \"or the craziest.\"\n\n\"Or both,\" said Kevin.\n\n\"Or both,\" I agreed.\n\nWe walked on in silence.

Hot Seat was the most popular show on MAHS-TV. Each week we put a post in the Hot Seat—a tweedy, secondhand easy chair we had picked up at Goodwill. The tweedy chair sat in the middle of a powerful spotlight. The tweedy person sat in the hot glare of tough questions.\n\nWe grilled them about their lives, their opinions, their most embarrassing moments. It was good-natured stuff, mostly. But sometimes the questions got edgy. We had gotten complaints from parents, even threats to cancel the show.\n\n\"Think she'll do it?\" I said.\n\n\"Why wouldn't she?\" said Kevin. \"Everybody wants to be on Hot Seat.\"\n\nThat was true. To be invited on the show was an honor. It meant you were somebody. But Stargirl? The rules didn't seem to apply to her.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"She's different.\"\n\nKevin grinned. \"Exactly. That's why she'd be perfect.\"\n\nI thought about it. The weird clothes. The ukulele. The pet rat. The dancing. There was so much to ask her. So much we wanted to know.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nWe decided to wait. We wanted to observe her a little longer. We wanted to have our questions ready. We wanted the show to be special.\n\nIn the meantime, the school continued to buzz about her.",
